     <hr>
        <p class="firstpara">New York City is made up of five boroughs which include Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The city is the home of approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France gifted the City of New York what is known as the Statue of Liberty, which is currently located on Liberty Island and commonly visited by tourists. However, it took 10 years to assemble and therefore wasn’t unveiled until 1886. Another tourist destination is Times Square. Times Square is commonly known for the big buildings, Broadway shows, and bright neon signs. This famous location was named after The New York Times after the Times moved to that location. Prior to that, it was named Longacre Square. 
New York City is also known for its bridges that connect the boroughs and allow ease of transportation.</p>

     <hr>
        <p>I have visited New York City twice myself. The first time was at Christmas time so I was able to see all of the xmas lights and decorations throughout the city so it really felt like every Christmas film based in New York. I visited with my girlfriend, mum and dad and it was amazing. The second time I went with just my girlfriend who turned into my fiancée by the end of the trip! We decided we wanted to go back to New York as there was places we didn't get to visit the previous time we was there and this time I decided it was the perfect time and place to propose. I proposed at Jane's Carousel in Brooklyn so that we had the city skyline and Brooklyn bridge in the background as I also hired a photographer to capture the special moment! </p>

         <td>8/10</td>
         <td class="td-new">What an experience! Madison Square Garden is always something you see in movies or online but until you visit you never quite understand the big deal about it. This is 100% worth visiting whether you are going to a concert or a sports event. For me, I went to watched a NBA game between the New York Knicks and the Golden State Warriors and the Knicks won! It was a great experience from the game itself, the venue, the merchandise and the crowd engagement throughout the game!</td>
         <td class="td-new">We was initially worried about our seats as we was quite high up, but honestly it seemed no matter where you sat, you was able to see everything! So I wouldn't worry about where your sitting, just get those tickets!</td>

</th>
         <td>10/10</td>
         <td class="td-new">Brooklyn Bridge gives you so many photo opportunities to capture different views of the city, whether you want a picture with the New York Skyline, Janes Carousel, the bridge itself or even an opportunity to get a photo of Lady Liberty herself! (weather depending) I visited Brooklyn Bridge on both of my visits to New York City and I would do it again whenever I decide to visit it again. You can visit early in the morning, in the evening or late at night, whenever you visit there are great photo opportunities at all times!</td>
         <td class="td-new">I would suggest going to the bridge for early morning sunrise or late evening sunset to get the best photos! Also beware, at the start of the bridge from the Manhattan side, there are lots of stools that are looking to sell you souvenirs, so it can get a bit crowded down that end.</td>

Walk through the city at a higher view, seeing the city in a different light whilst hovering above the roads amongst the highrise buildings. This walkway starts at Chelsea Pier and ends at Hudson Yards, which are also two great areas to explore!</td>
         <td class="td-new">This can get very busy and people like to be on the move constantly, so be aware of others when stopping to take your photos!</td>

You can ice skate in the middle of central park with the city skyline situated in the background just rising over the surrounding trees. This was a great experience and one I would 100% recommend, but I believe this ice rink is only here around Christmas time so be sure to check ahead and book to learn when this amazing rink is here!</td>
         <td class="td-new">This can get very busy so allow plenty of time for queuing and be sure to purchase your tickets months prior to visiting to ensure you do not miss out!</td>

There are some amazing spots throughout the park to stop, take photos and take all of the surroundings in whilst grabbing a bite to eat or a drink. This is a 100% recommend when visiting New York! </td>
         <td class="td-new">Again, this park can get very busy and the roads throughout the park do have cars coming through on them sometimes so be aware of your surroundings when cycling through.</td>

         <td class="td-new">A boat tour on the Hudson river to Lady Liberty should definitely be on your list of things to do as seeing this statue is essential to any person visiting New York City. We decided instead of getting a boat to Liberty Island and getting off to see Lady Liberty, we booked a boat tour that takes you around the island of Manhattan and steers up close to the statue so we could still see her up close and personal without having to spend hours on the island itself which we felt worked out way better as you can get some great photos from the river. This tour also took us under Brooklyn River and to other areas of New York, allowing us to see multiple things in one short trip.</td>

Monkey Bar opened in 1936 and still has a timeless feel and iconic vibe to it, making you feel like its classic New York City! Not only was the interior aesthetic amazing but the food was to die for! We didn't go for any starters as we wasn't massively hungry but we know the Truffle Monkey Bread and the Slow Roasted Wagyu Meatballs are two favourites! For mains we had the Vodka Rigatoni and the Wagyu Cheeseburger which was both outstanding!</td>

         <td class="td-new">In almost every film based in New York, you'll see times square and its such a surreal place to see when you first visit it. With its bright lights, large crowds and public shows, its a great place to walk through during the day or in the evening. You can also grab a variety of different foods here including the TikTok famous Raising Canes, which I'm afraid, did not live up to the hype!</td>

With a classic style carousel in a glass box (that you can ride), perfect views of the city and a place to relax away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre, Jane's Carousel is a great place to visit!</td>
         <td class="td-new">I'd recommend visiting here at sunrise, as the majority of people go to Brooklyn Bridge for sunrise so when we visited Jane's Carousel at sunrise, we had the whole place to ourselves. Its also the perfect place to propose to someone! *wink wink* </td>

Especially at Christmas time, when the Rockefeller Tree is up and the Rockefeller Ice rink is there, it creates a great Christmassy feel!</td>
